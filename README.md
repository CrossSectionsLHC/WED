This repository contains the cross section and branching ratios for spin 0 and spin 2 particles in the framework of Warped Extra Dimensions

We consider two limits of this class of model: RS1 and bulk.

Updates: 

- We use the aMC@NLO model files made for Higgs Characterization to simulate the inclusive cross sections @NLO level in QCD

- We use PDF4LHC15_nlo_mc_pdfas and the recommended recipes for theory uncertainties

We add the calculations for:
 - EW induced associated production with two jets (that includes VBF production) 
 - associated production with W/Z
 - photon production

Now BR and XS are calculated in the same points!
There are 2 tables for BRs in each subfolder, the only difference among them is the quantity of mass points in the table

The documentation is being updated 1404.0102


GF = inclusive production
PF = photon fusion 
VX = Associated production with a vector boson
Xjj = Electroweak induced associated production with two jets
